#TO DO:

[] Need to deal with NORMAL WEEKLY SCHEDULE
  - visibility (or not) on /team-calendar
  - edit and visibility on teammembercalendar
  - I think we need a new event type just called "Working" 
    So that every person can have their set schedule with their normal "Working" hours and "Not Working" days/hours

[] Show Weekends toggle

[] Team Members should be automnatically added to DB

[] SETTINGS PAGE: (see mockups)
  - Team member in/ex-clusion 
  - Calendar subscription feeds
  - ...

[] "All Team" events (Custom)... could either just allow NOT selecting a Team Member for generic "everyone" events.. or could include an "All Team" in the Team Member list ..?  (for things like "Yard Meeting")

[] Ways to add/edit/delete Members - or an auto way to make sure they are always synced with Jobber
